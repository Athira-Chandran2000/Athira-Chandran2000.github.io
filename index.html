    <h3>Cross-Lingual Speaker Verification for Indic Languages</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a robust cross-lingual speaker verification system by pre-training
      on high-resource English (LibriSpeech) and fine-tuning on low-resource Indic
      languages such as Tamil and Malayalam. Implemented an ECAPA-Conformer
      architecture with multi-head attention to fuse spectral and prosodic features.
      Enhanced embedding discriminability using hybrid AAM-Softmax and Triplet loss,
      combined with extensive data augmentation.

    <h3>Multilingual Hate Speech Detection using ML and Transformers</h3>
    <p>
      Designed a multilingual hate speech detection pipeline for English and Malayalam
      social media datasets. Compared traditional machine learning models, CNN–BiLSTM
      architectures, and transformer-based models including BERT, MuRIL, mBERT, and
      IndicBERT. Addressed class imbalance and optimized hyperparameters for low-resource
      NLP settings.
    </p>

  <article class="project-card">
    <h3>Neonatal HIE Segmentation and Classification Framework</h3>
    <p>
      Proposed a two-stage framework combining deep learning–based medical image
      segmentation and machine learning classification. Achieved a Dice score of 0.749
      and classification accuracy of 89%, with improved consistency across severity
      grades. Presented at IEEE INDICON 2025.
