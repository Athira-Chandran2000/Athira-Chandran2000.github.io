  <h2>Research & Projects</h2>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Cross-Lingual Speaker Verification for Indic Languages</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a robust cross-lingual speaker verification system by pre-training on
      high-resource English (LibriSpeech) and fine-tuning on low-resource Indic languages
      such as Tamil and Malayalam. Implemented an advanced ECAPA-Conformer architecture
      with a multi-head attention mechanism to fuse spectral features (Log-Mel, MFCC)
      and prosodic features (pitch, energy). Enhanced embedding discriminability using
      a hybrid AAM-Softmax and Triplet loss, combined with extensive data augmentation
      techniques including SpecAugment, noise injection, and reverberation to improve robustness.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Multilingual Hate Speech Detection Using ML and Transformers</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a multilingual hate speech detection system for English and Malayalam
      social media datasets. Implemented and compared traditional machine learning models
      (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), CNN-BiLSTM hybrid architectures, and
      transformer-based models including BERT, MuRIL, mBERT, and IndicBERT.
      Addressed class imbalance and optimized hyperparameters to ensure reliable
      performance on low-resource language data.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Indian Food Detection and Nutrient Estimation using YOLOv5</h3>
    <p>
      Built a computer vision-based data science pipeline to detect Indian food items
      and associate them with nutritional data. Compared multiple optimization strategies
      and achieved a mAP@0.5 score of 0.76. Reduced false positives by 18% through optimizer
      and confidence threshold tuning. Evaluated model behavior to understand limitations
      and real-world applicability.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Integrated Segmentation and Classification Framework for Neonatal HIE</h3>
    <p>
      Designed a two-stage framework combining deep learning-based medical image
      segmentation with machine learning classification to analyze neonatal HIE.
      Performed extensive data exploration and feature extraction to capture imaging
      patterns associated with disease severity. Achieved a Dice score of 0.749 and
      classification accuracy of 89%, with improved consistency across severity grades
      reflected by a macro F1-score of 0.83. Presented the work at IEEE INDICON 2025.
